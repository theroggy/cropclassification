# CHANGELOG

## ???

### Deprecations and compatibility notes

- To provide the possibility to specify any hyperparameter for sklearn classifiers, the
  parameters will now have to be specified as a json string instead of in individual
  parameters when such a classifier is used. Because of this, the following parameters
  become obsolete + the default values will become the default values in sklearn (#110):
    - randomforest_n_estimators: default 100 instead of 200
    - randomforest_max_depth: default None instead of 35
    - multilayer_perceptron_hidden_layer_sizes: default (100,) instead of (100, 100)
    - multilayer_perceptron_max_iter: default 200 instead of 1000
    - multilayer_perceptron_learning_rate_init

### Improvements

- Add task/action to automate periodic download of images (#67)
- Add support to calculate indexes locally (#55)
- Improve config and handling of "weekly" and "biweekly" raster image periods (#78)
- Add possibility to configure any possible hyperparameter for the supported sklearn
  based classifiers (#110)
- Add support for HistGradientBoostingClassifier (#95)
- Make image profiles to be used in a classification configurable in a config file (#56)
- Add option to overrule configuration parameters at runtime (#92)
- If image period is e.g. "weekly", align `start_date` of a marker to the next monday
  instead of the previous one to avoid using data outside the dates provided (#83, #84)
- Add method "best available pixel" on openeo for S2 (#70)
- Add utility script to recalculate reports for an existing run + make recalculation
  more robust for old runs (#91, #102, #103, #104, #106)
- Improve pixelcount calculation for parcels (#96, #105)
- Improve calculation of beta error in reporting (#97)
- Add whether a parcel has been used for training to output (#107)
- Run `bulk_zonal_stats` in low priority worker processes (#81)
- Use ruff instead of black and flake for formatting and linting (#57, #64, #65, #67)
- Updates to avoid warnings from (newer versions of) dependencies like pandas,
  geofileops (#88, #109)

### Bugs fixed

- Various fixes and improvements to `bulk_zonal_statistics` with engine="pyqgis"
  (#76, #80)
- Fix some group names being wrong/unclear in the classification reporting (#90)

## 0.1.1 (2023-08-08)

### Improvements

- Clip s2 and s1 timeseries values to one to avoid outliers > 1 (#47)
- Change default time_reducer to mean for both s1 and s2 (#48)

## 0.1.0
### Improvements

- Add support to use openeo for image retrieval/calculation (#36)
- Improve performance of zonal_stats_bulk (#38)
- Use black to comply to pep8 + minor general improvements (#13)
- Upgrade all dependencies (#12)
- Add support for pandas 2.0 (#21)
